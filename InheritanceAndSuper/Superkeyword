What is the super Keyword? #
As you already know that this keyword in Java is used to refer to the instance of the current class.

Accessing Parent Class Fields #
Consider the fields named as fuelCap defined inside a Vehicle class to keep track of the fuel capacity of a vehicle. Another class named as Car extends from this Vehicle class.

Now if we want to refer to the fuelCap field of the SuperClass inside the Subclass, we will then have to use the super keyword.
